## Auditing Dangerous Function Use

Using Semgrep to audit dangerous function calls is easy.

1. Match a function call by name.
2. Filter out hardcoded strings.
3. Look explicitly for dangerous keyword arguments.

Let's do an example with the `subprocess` module in Python.

**Match the function call by name.** The ellipsis operator `...` abstracts away whole segments of code. Effectively, it says "I don't care about what's in here."

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern: subprocess.call(...)
```

```python
import subprocess
import sys

subprocess.call("echo 'hello'") # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1])) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True, cwd="/home/user") # Matches here
subprocess.run("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Doesn't match here
```

**Filter out hardcoded strings.** The ellipsis operator can be used inside quotes to represent any string literal. We can filter out static strings by using this with the `pattern-not` clause.

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not: subprocess.call("...")
- pattern: subprocess.call(...)
```

```python
import subprocess
import sys

subprocess.call("echo 'hello'") # Doesn't match here anymore!
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1])) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True, cwd="/home/user") # Matches here
subprocess.run("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Doesn't match here
```

**Look explicitly for dangerous keyword arguments.** You may want to match only when [certain keyword arguments are present](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations). For example, when subprocess.call is passed the keyword argument shell=True, Python won't auto-escape shell metacharacters that are passed in, which, if an attacker has control over the input, may lead to them being able to run arbitrary shell commands.

We can match keyword arguments just like in Python into our pattern. Combined with the ellipsis operator, this pattern will match if `shell=True` appears at the end of the sequence of arguments.

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not: subprocess.call("...")
- pattern: subprocess.call(..., shell=True)
```

```python
import subprocess
import sys

subprocess.call("echo 'hello'") # Doesn't match
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1])) # Doesn't match here anymore!
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True, cwd="/home/user") # Oops! We don't match here anymore either!
subprocess.run("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Doesn't match here
```

Semgrep will match `(..., shell=True)` only when `shell=True` is the last argument, but that's not what we want, as `shell=True` is dangerous regardless of the order in which it's passed in. We can update our pattern to handle cases where `shell=True` is a keyword argument regardless of the order it's passed in by using the ellipsis operator on both sides of `shell=True`.

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not: subprocess.call("...")
- pattern: subprocess.call(..., shell=True, ...)
```

```python
import subprocess
import sys

subprocess.call("echo 'hello'") # Doesn't match
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1])) # Doesn't match
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True, cwd="/home/user") # Matches here too!
subprocess.run("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Doesn't match here
```

**Bonus: Match any `subprocess` function with `shell=True`.** As you probably noticed, `subprocess.run` is subject to the same issue as `subprocess.call`. `subprocess.run` [was made available in Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#older-high-level-api). We can match both `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.run` by using **metavariables**. 

Metavariables let you match any code expression. To use metavariables in Semgrep, use the dollar sign as a prefix and all capital letters. In this example, we will use `subprocess.$FUNC`. The name can be anything -- it's just a like a variable in a normal language and will "hold" the expression it matches.

To learn more about metavariables, visit the [primary documentation](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/pattern-features.md#metavariables). 

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not: subprocess.$FUNC("...")
- pattern: subprocess.$FUNC(..., shell=True, ...)
```

```python
import subprocess
import sys

subprocess.call("echo 'hello'") # Doesn't match
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1])) # Doesn't match
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Matches here
subprocess.call("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True, cwd="/home/user") # Matches here
subprocess.run("grep -R {} .".format(sys.argv[1]), shell=True) # Matches here too!
```

## Enforce Specific Use of an API

Sometimes you may wish to enforce the specific use of an API. There are many examples of this, such as `subprocess.call(..., shell=True, ...)` above; you may wish to match and fail any commit where `shell=True`. This is easy to do in Semgrep, as seen in the above section.

However, there are also APIs that are insecure by default--or insecure depending on context, such as Jinja2, which does [not enable autoescaping by default](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/2a8515d2e53a2be475d9df3fe44e308501201a95/src/jinja2/environment.py#L296). Jinja2 is an arbitrary templating engine, so this makes sense in non-web contexts. This may not be obvious, though, and if you are working directly with the Jinja2 engine in a web context, you want to make sure to include `autoescape=True`.

(Not to scare anyone: Flask, for instance, [autoescapes templates with the '.html' extension](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/blob/2a8515d2e53a2be475d9df3fe44e308501201a95/src/jinja2/environment.py#L296).)

This is an interesting case because we want to enforce the **presence** of `autoescape=True`. *Matching* this is easy:

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern: jinja2.Environment(..., autoescape=True, ...)
```

But what we *want* is to alert when the *opposite* conditions are met. Therefore we want to match (1) when `autoescape=False` **and** (2) when `autoescape` is not present in the function call at all! This pattern will match when `jinja2.Environment()` does not contain `autoescape=True`:

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not: jinja2.Environment(..., autoescape=True, ...)
- pattern: jinja2.Environment(...)
```

The full version of this rule, which filters out additional cases, looks like this: https://semgrep.live/WADz.


This can be generalized with the following approach:

1. Match the function call by name.
2. Filter out good patterns.

### Secure Cookies in Flask

Another example of this approach is [setting secure cookies in Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/security/#set-cookie-options).

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not: flask.response.set_cookie(..., httponly=True, secure=True,...)
- pattern: flask.response.set_cookie(...)
```

## Ensure One Function is Called Before Another

You can ensure one function is called before another in Semgrep by utilizing the `pattern-not-inside` clause. The approach will be:

1. Match the last function call by name.
2. Filter out when the right function is called above.

**Match the last function call by name.** Let's use [this Java example from semgrep.live](https://semgrep.live/7K9G). We want to make sure `verify_transaction` is called before `make_transaction`. First, match the function call that should be called last. In this case, it's `make_transaction`. (Yes, they're normally called "methods." Stick with me.)

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern: make_transaction(...);
```

https://semgrep.live/QrbJ

**Filter out when the right function is called above.** Next, we can filter out the case where `verify_transaction` appears above. To do this, we will use the [`pattern-not-inside` clause](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/blob/develop/docs/configuration-files.md#pattern-not-inside). `pattern-not-inside` will filter out **ranges**, inclusive of the ellipsis operator. The patterns look like this:

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not-inside: |
    verify_transaction(...);
    ...
- pattern: make_transaction(...);
```

(The pipe (`|`) is YAML syntax that permits a multi-line string.)

If I were to describe this pattern in English, it would read: Filter out any matches inside statements after `verify_transaction`, otherwise match `make_transaction`. Written another way: match `make_transaction` only when `verify_transaction` is not above.

https://semgrep.live/8Gzg

**Bonus: Ensure the same variable is used in both functions.** The above patterns has three matches in the given examples. There is a fourth case to match where the *wrong* `Transaction` object is verified. To match only when the same variable is used in both functions, we can use a metavariable. Just like variables, a Semgrep pattern will match only when the metavariables are the same wherever it is used. We can augment the pattern like this to catch the fourth case:

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not-inside: |
    verify_transaction($TRANSACTION);
    ...
- pattern: make_transaction($TRANSACTION);
```

### Secure Cookies in Java

A real example of this is setting the secure flag on cookies in Java. `Cookie` objects are added to `HttpServletResponse` objects, and to set the secure flag, `setSecure(true)` must be called on the `Cookie` object prior to its addition.

```java
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("key", "value");
cookie.setSecure(true);
response.addCookie(cookie);
```

Matching this is the same approach as `make_transaction` above.

1. Match `response.addCookie(...)`.
2. Filter out when `setSecure(true)` is called.

Since we can't know the name of the variables in advance, we can use metavariables for the `Cookie` and `HttpServletResponse` objects. The patterns look like this:

```yaml
patterns:
- pattern-not-inside: |
    $COOKIE.setSecure(true);
    ...
- pattern: $RESP.addCookie($COOKIE);
```
