Semgrep is a simple and highly customizable [command-line](#installation) and [online](https://semgrep.live/) tool for static code and variant analysis. Find bugs and anti-patterns in your codebase using pre-built or custom checks, across many languages.

Semgrep combines the convenience and rapid iteration speed of `grep`, but is "code-aware"; you can easily match function calls, class or method definitions, and more with simple patterns. See [Installation](#installation) and [Usage](#usage) to get started.

## Installation

On macOS, binaries are available via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/semgrep):

```bash
$ brew install returntocorp/semgrep/semgrep
```

On Ubuntu, an install script is available with each [release](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep/releases/download/v0.10.1/semgrep-v0.10.1-ubuntu-generic.sh)

```bash
$ ./semgrep-v0.10.1-ubuntu-generic.sh
```

To try Semgrep without installation, you can also run it via [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/):

```
$ docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/home/repo" returntocorp/semgrep --help
``` 

See [Usage](#usage) to learn about running pre-built rules and writing custom ones.

## Motivation

Semgrep exists because:

1. Insecure code is easy to write
2. The future of security involves automatically guiding developers towards a ‚Äúpaved road‚Äù made of default-safe frameworks (i.e. [React](https://reactjs.org/) or Object-relational Mappers)
3. `grep` isn‚Äôt expressive enough and traditional static analysis tools (SAST) are too complicated/slow for paved road automation

The AppSec, Developer, and DevOps community deserves a static analysis tool that is fast, easy to use, code-aware, multi-lingual, and open source!

## Overview

### Key features

* **Language aware**: Semgrep parses source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), so it understands function calls, method and class definitions, conditionals, and more. Unlike regexes, Semgrep won't get tripped up matching things you don't care about in comments or string literals.
* **Fast**: Speedy enough to run on every build, commit, or file save.
* **Batteries included**: Leverage hundreds of pre-built rules for popular languages and frameworks in the community [registry](https://semgrep.live/r), including coverage for the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).
* **Handles multiple languages**: No need to learn and maintain multiple tools for your polyglot environment (e.g. ESLint, find-sec-bugs, rubocop, gosec, ...).
* **Easy to tweak**: Rules look like the code you‚Äôre searching, no static analysis PhD required.
* **Runs on source code**: Semgrep doesn‚Äôt require compilation because it runs on source code directly.
* **Easy to integrate**: Highly portable and many CI and git hook integrations already exist. Run via CLI or Docker, output `--json` and pipe results into whatever system you want.

### Pattern Syntax Teaser

One of the most unique and useful things about Semgrep is how easy it is to write and iterate on queries.

The goal is to make it as *easy as possible* to go from an idea in your head to finding the code patterns you intend to.

**Example**: Say you want to find all calls to a function named `exec`, and you don't care about the arguments. With Semgrep, you could simply supply the pattern `exec(...)` and you'd match:

~~~python
# Simple cases grep finds
exec("ls")
exec(some_var)

# But you don't have to worry about whitespace
exec (foo)

# Or calls across multiple lines
exec (
    bar
)
~~~

Importantly, Semgrep would *not* match the following:

~~~python
# grep would match this, but semgrep ignores it because
# it doesn't have the right function name
other_exec(bar)

# semgrep ignores commented out lines
# exec(foo)

# and hard-coded strings
print("exec(bar)")
~~~

Semgrep will even match aliased imports:

~~~python
# Semgrep knows that safe_function refers to exec so it
# will still match!
#   Oof, try finding this with grep
import exec as safe_function
safe_function(tricksy)
~~~

Play with this example in your browser [here](https://semgrep.live/QrkD), or copy the above code into a file locally (`exec.py`) and run:

~~~python
$ semgrep -l python -e "exec(...)" /path/to/exec.py
~~~

More example patterns:

| **Pattern**                                                        | **Matches**                                                |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| [`$X == $X`](https://semgrep.live/20B)                             | `if (node.id == node.id): ...`                             |
| [`requests.get(..., verify=False, ...)`](https://semgrep.live/jqn) | `requests.get(url, timeout=3, verify=False)`               |
| [`os.system(...)`](https://semgrep.live/1W5)                       | `from os import system; system('echo semgrep')`            |
| [`$ELEMENT.innerHTML`](https://semgrep.live/9ze)                   | ``el.innerHTML = "<img src='x' onerror='alert(`XSS`)'>";`` |
| [`$TOKEN.SignedString([]byte("..."))`](https://semgrep.live/rXW)   | `ss, err := token.SignedString([]byte("HARDCODED KEY"))`   |

‚Üí [see more example patterns in the Semgrep registry](https://semgrep.live/registry).

For more info on what you can do in patterns, see the [pattern features
docs](docs/pattern-features.md).

## Terminology

A **rule** (or *check*) is a Semgrep pattern that can be used to find source code of interest.

A **rule pack** (or *check pack*) is a collection of Semgrep rules bundled
together. For example, "Here are a bunch of Java checks I want to run."

## Usage

Generally when you're using Semgrep you're going to be doing one of three things:

1. Manually scanning your source code using existing rules.
1. Running Semgrep in CI so every pull request (PR) is scanned.
1. Writing new rules.

The following sections cover each in more detail.

### üîç 1. Run Existing Rules

The easiest way to get started with Semgrep (other than [semgrep.live](https://semgrep.live/)) is to scan your code with pre-built rules.

The [Semgrep rule registry](https://semgrep.live/r) contains rules for many programming errors, including security issues and correctness bugs. Security rules are annotated with CWE and OWASP metadata when applicable. OWASP rule coverage per language is displayed below.

<p align="center">
    <img width="600" src="https://web-assets.r2c.dev/semgrep-rules-owasp-coverage-20200520.png" style="max-width:100%;" />
</p>

You can use pre-built [Rule Packs](https://semgrep.live/packs), that contain sets of rules grouped by language and/or framework:

```bash
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/java
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/python
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/golang
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/p/javascript
...
```

Or you can run all of Semgrep's default rules for all languages as appropriate (note: each rule says what language it's for, so Semgrep won't try to run a Python rule on Java code).

```bash
$ semgrep --config=r2c
```

You can also run a specific rule or group of rules:

```bash
# Run a specific rule
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/r/java.spring.security.audit.cookie-missing-samesite

# Run a set of rules
$ semgrep --config=https://semgrep.live/c/r/java.spring.security
```

All Semgrep rules can be viewed on the [Rule Registry page](https://semgrep.live/r), which pulls the rules from YAML files defined in the [semgrep-rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules) GitHub repo.

Here are some sample vulnerable repos to test on:
* Django: [lets-be-bad-guys](https://github.com/mpirnat/lets-be-bad-guys), [django.nV](https://github.com/nVisium/django.nV)
* Flask: [Vulnerable-Flask-App](https://github.com/we45/Vulnerable-Flask-App)
* Java: [WebGoat](https://github.com/WebGoat/WebGoat), [OWASP Benchmark](https://github.com/OWASP/Benchmark)
* NodeJS: [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop), [DevSlop Pixi](https://github.com/DevSlop/Pixi)
* Golang: [GoVWA](https://github.com/0c34/govwa)


### üõ°Ô∏è 2. Integrate into CI

Semgrep can be run via CLI or Docker and output results as JSON (via the `--json` flag), so it can be inserted into any CI pipeline and have its results processed by whatever tools you're using.

Semgrep is aware of *diffs*, so it can report only findings that occur in newly added code, for example, in a commit or pull request.

Currently, the easiest way to integrate Semgrep into CI is via a GitHub action we've built. See the [integrations docs](docs/integrations.md) for more details.

Semgrep can also output results in the standardized Static Analysis Results Interchange Format ([SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cs01/sarif-v2.1.0-cs01.html)) with the `--sarif` flag, if you use tools that accept this format.

### ‚úçÔ∏è 3. Writing Rules

One of the strengths of Semgrep is how easy it is to write rules.

This makes it possible to:
* Quickly port rules from other tools.
* Think of an interesting code pattern, and then find instances of it in your
    code.
* Find code base or org-specific bugs and antipatterns - things that built-in
    checks for existing tools won't find because they're unique to you.
* and more!

#### Simple Rules

For iterating on simple patterns, you can use the `--lang` and `--pattern`
flags.

```bash
$ semgrep --lang javascript --pattern 'eval(...)' path/to/file.js
```

The `--lang` flag tells Semgrep which language you're targeting and `--pattern` is the code pattern to search for.

#### Advanced Rules

Some rules need more than one line of pattern to express. Sometimes you want to express code patterns, like: `X` must be true AND `Y` must be too, or `X` but NOT `Y`, or `X` must occur inside a block of code that `Y` matches.

For these cases, Semgrep has a more powerful and flexible [YAML syntax](docs/configuration-files.md).

You can run a single rule or directory of rules specified in YAML by:
```bash
$ semgrep --config my_rule.yml path/to/dir_or_file

$ semgrep --config yaml_dir/ path/to/dir_or_file
```

**Example Advanced Rule**

Say you are building a financial trading application in which every `Transaction` object must first be passed to `verify_transaction()` before being passed to `make_transaction()`, or it's a business logic bug.

You can express this behavior with the following Semgrep YAML pattern:

```yaml
rules:
- id: find-unverified-transactions
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){
            ...
            make_transaction($T);
            ...
        }
    - pattern-not: |
        public $RETURN $METHOD(...){
            ...
            verify_transaction($T);
            ...
            make_transaction($T);
            ...
        }
  message: |
    In $METHOD, there's a call to make_transaction() without first calling verify_transaction() on the Transaction object.
```

* `$RETURN`, `$METHOD`, and `$T` are *metavariables*, an abstraction that Semgrep provides when you want to match something but you don't know exactly what it is ahead of time.
  * You can think of *metavariables* like a [capture group](https://regexone.com/lesson/capturing_groups) in regular expressions.
* The `pattern` clause defines what we're looking for: any method that calls `make_transaction()`.
* The `pattern-not` clause *filters out* matches we don't want; in this case, methods where a transaction (`$T`) is passed to `verify_transaction()` before `make_transaction()`.
* The `message` is what's returned in Semgrep output, either to STDOUT or as a comment on the pull request on GitHub or other systems.
  * Note that *metavariables* can be used to customize messages and make them
    contextually relevant. Here we're helpfully telling the user the method
    where we've identified the bug.

You can play with this transaction example here: https://semgrep.live/4b4g.
