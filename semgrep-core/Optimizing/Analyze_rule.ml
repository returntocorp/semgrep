(* Analyzing a semgrep rule for optimization purpose.
 *
 * Analyze_pattern.ml tries to extract a regexp from a pattern
 * in order to skip certain target files. However, it processes only
 * one pattern at a time and is not aware of the context in which this
 * pattern is used. For example in:
 *
 *  id: eval-not-in-foo
 *  patterns:
 *    - pattern: eval(...)
 *    - pattern-not:
 *        require("foo.js")
 *        ...
 *
 * the current Mii_rules_filter used in Semgrep_generic will just see a flat
 * list of patterns, and will look separately for 'eval' and 'foo.js'
 * and filter certain patterns; But really, even if 'foo.js' is mentioned
 * in a file, we should completly skip the file if 'eval' is not in the file
 * because after all 'foo.js' is mentioned in a pattern-not context!
 *
 * There are many optimization opportunities when semgrep-core can see
 * the whole rule:
 *  - TODO skip the pattern-not when computing the regexp
 *  - TODO if a pattern is very general (e.g., $FOO()), but is
 *    also mentioned in a metavariable-regexp, then we can use this
 *    regexp to filter the rule/target file.
 *  - TODO if a pattern is very general (e.g., $PROP), but reference
 *    metavariables used in other patterns, then you can skip this pattern
*)
