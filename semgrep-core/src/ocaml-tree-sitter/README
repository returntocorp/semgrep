These are symlinks to only the runtime library of ocaml-tree-sitter, which is
needed to build semgrep-core.

The main issue is that the ocaml-tree-sitter repo comes with massive git
submodules that we don't want to accidentally fetch. So we avoid having
ocaml-tree-sitter as a submodule. We also avoid a global opam installation
from a git URL since it also appears to fetch all the submodules (?) and is a
bit easier to work with.
