(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* Helper functions for the Nathan's bloom filter optimization to skip
 * matching certain patterns against some code in semgrep.
 *
 * The intuition is that if the pattern contains an identifier like in
 * 'foo();', there is no point in running the Semgrep matching engine on all
 * the statements in the program if those statements do not contain this
 * identifier.
 * The Bloom filter allows to generalize this idea to a set of identifiers
 * that must be present in some statements while still being space-efficient.
 *
 * Note that we must make sure we don't skip statements we should analyze!
 * For example with the naming aliasing, a pattern like 'foo()'
 * should be matched on code like 'bar()' if bar was actualy an alias
 * for foo via a previous import.
 * The same is true for user-defined equivalences when a pattern contains
 * A DisjExpr, in which case we may need a set of Bloom filters for each
 * branch. Another example are integer literals, which in OCaml
 * can be written as 1000 or 1_000, so we want to do the bloom hasking
 * on the integer final value, not the string.
 *
 * See also semgrep-core/matching/Rules_filter.ml

(* Note: If the bottom most node has n strings and k parents, it will take
 * O(kn) to add it to all the lists. Since it will also take O(kn) to add it
 * to all the bloom filters, this is acceptable, but it would not be
 * necessary if we used a linked list
*)
