(*****************************************************************************)
(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* The core engine of Semgrep.
 *
 * This module implements the boolean composition of patterns.
 * See Semgrep_generic.ml for the code to handle a single pattern and
 * the visitor/matching engine.
 *
 * Thus, we can decompose the engine in 3 main components:
 *  - composing matching results using boolean/set logic (this file)
 *  - visiting code (=~ Semgrep_generic.ml)
 *  - matching code (=~ Generic_vs_generic.ml)
 *
 * There are also "preprocessing" work before that:
 *  - parsing (lexing, parsing) rules, code, patterns
 *  - normalizing (convert to a generic AST)
 *  - naming (but bugs probably)
 *  - SEMI typing (propagating type decls at least and small inference)
 *  - SEMI analyzing (dataflow constant propagation)
 *    but could do much more: deep static analysis using Datalog?
 *
 * TODO
 *  - spacegrep, link with spacegrep lib :)
 *  - regexp, use PCRE compatible regexp OCaml lib
 *  - metavar comparison, use Eval_generic :)
 *  - pattern-where-python? use pycaml? works for dlint rule?
 *    right now only 4 rules are using pattern-where-python
 *
 * LATER (if really decide to rewrite the python wrapper in OCaml):
 *  - paths
 *  - autofix
 *  - ...
 *
 * FUTURE WORK:
 * Right now we just analyze one file at a time. Later we could
 * maybe take a list of files and do some global analysis for:
 *     * caller/callee in different files
 *     * inheritance awareness, because right now we can't match
 *       code that inherit indirectly form a class mentioned in a pattern
 * There are different options for such global analysis:
 *  - generate a giant file a la CIL, but scale?
 *  - do it via a 2 passes process. 1st pass iterate over all files, report
 *    already matches, record semantic information (e.g., inheritance tree,
 *    call graph, etc.) as it goes, and let the matching engine report
 *    todo_second_pass if for example is_children returned a Maybe.
 *    Then in 2nd pass just process the files that were marked as todo.
 *  - use LSP, so don't even need 2 pass and can even work when passing
 *    a single file or subdir to semgrep
 *
 * Note that we opted here for simple patterns with simple extensions
 * to the grammar (metavar, ellipsis) with simple (but powerful) logic
 * compositions of patterns.
 * Coccinelle instead opted for very complex patterns and using CTL to
 * hold of that together.
