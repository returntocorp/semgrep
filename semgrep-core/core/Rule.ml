(* Prelude *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* The goal of this module is to make it easy to add lint rules by using
 * sgrep patterns. You just have to store in a special file the patterns
 * and the corresponding warning you want the linter to raise.
 *
 * update: if you need advanced patterns with boolean logic (which used
 * to be partially provided by the hacky OK error keyword), use
 * instead the sgrep python wrapper! It also uses a yaml file but it
 * has more features, e.g. some pattern-either fields, pattern-inside,
 * where-eval, etc.
*)

  (* Useful for debugging, to report bad rules. We could rule.id to
   * report those bad rules, but semgrep-python uses a weird encoding
   * when flattening the pattern-xxx (-and, -either, -not, etc.)
   * patterns in the original rule yaml file, which makes it hard
   * to know what what was the corresponding pattern.
